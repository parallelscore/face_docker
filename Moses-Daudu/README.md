# Capture Unique Faces In A Blury Video

Hi my name is `Moses Daudu` 

This repo contains source code of the implementation of a model that is dear to me.
The model identifies faces even in cases where the faces are blured. It took a long time to annotate the dataset, but it was worth it

## Step 1:
Install all requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 2:
Run the `python` file
`python face_detect.py`
